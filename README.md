# Advanced Algorithms Midterm

The goal of this project is to extend the original Dijkstra algorithm by implementing a custom priority queue and evaluating a parallel edge relaxation approach using Ran Duan, Jiayi Mao, Xiao Mao, Xinkai Shu and Longhui Yin's paper on Breaking the Sorting Barrier for Directed Single-Source Shortest Paths as the source of inspiration. The optimized versions will be compared against the classical implementation to measure performance improvements on a variety of different input graphs.
